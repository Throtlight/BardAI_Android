# üó®Ô∏è BardAI Android
‚öôÔ∏è Chatbot "Google Bard" as an application using the WebView implementation.
## Description
‚úçÔ∏è This application is an implementation of the web version of the Bard chatbot, through the use of WebView; at startup, there is a splash screen that lasts while the web page is loading.
 This in turn minimizes the feeling that the application is running on a WebView.
 The advantages of this approach are that there is no Chrome interface, which is saved if you create a shortcut on the desktop.  In this application there is only you and Bard.
## ‚ú® Properties
1. Working clipboard.
2. Correct display of interface elements.
3. Automatic Google authorization via Gboard.
